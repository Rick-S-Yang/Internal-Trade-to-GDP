# Internal Trade to GDP  
### Empirical Analysis on Political Decentralization and Domestic Trade Integration

## Project Overview
This project investigates the relationship between **political decentralization** and the **share of internal trade in GDP** across countries.  
Using cross-country panel data and econometric analysis in **R**, the project aims to understand how institutional structures influence domestic market integration and economic activity.

The analysis focuses on whether higher levels of decentralization are associated with changes in internal trade intensity, with implications for economic coordination and policy design.

---

## Research Question
- How does political decentralization affect a country’s **internal trade as a percentage of GDP**?
- Does decentralization strengthen or weaken domestic economic integration?

---

## Data Sources
The analysis uses publicly available and widely cited datasets, including:

- **World Bank** – macroeconomic indicators (GDP, trade measures)
- **Regional Authority Index (RAI)** – political decentralization indicators
- **World Input-Output Database (WIOD)** – internal trade and production data

The final dataset consists of panel data covering **42 countries** across multiple years.

---

## Methodology
- Cleaned and merged multi-source international datasets using **R**
- Constructed key variables for internal trade intensity and decentralization
- Conducted econometric regression analysis to estimate relationships between institutional and trade variables
- Applied economic reasoning to interpret coefficient signs and magnitudes

---

## Key Findings
- Countries with higher levels of political decentralization tend to exhibit **lower internal trade-to-GDP ratios**
- Results suggest that decentralization may reduce domestic trade integration due to increased regional fragmentation
- Findings highlight the importance of institutional coordination in sustaining integrated national markets

---

## Economic and Policy Implications
- Strong domestic market integration plays a critical role in economic resilience and efficiency  
- Policymakers should consider trade-offs between regional autonomy and national economic coordination  
- The results provide insight into how governance structures can influence internal economic linkages

---

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and manipulation in **R**
- Cross-country panel data analysis
- Econometric reasoning and interpretation
- Translating empirical results into economic insights

## Notes
This project emphasizes analytical thinking and empirical interpretation rather than predictive modeling, aligning with economic research and policy-oriented analysis.
